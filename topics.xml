Motions that Artists Err DRY Fled t

Ambllaf Piscine Trotting and Galloplnsr
Prof Enclwoard MuybrUlgo delivered last
evening In the Turf Club Theatre an oxcood
Incly Interesting lecture upon tho attitudes of
animals In motion Illustrating I by photo
graphs made by Instantaneous process and by
a machine called tho zoOpraxIscopo which
caused animals and human beings to appear In
actual motion upon tho screen In a etartllnnly
lifelike manner Ho explained first tho In
iconlous apparatus by which those pictures
were made a series of twentyfour cameras
each fitted with an oloctrooxposor that ox
posed the negative to tho light forono fivethou
sandth of a second when an animal In motion
before It broko a thread and made the eloctrio
connection
connocton
The series of pictures thus produced repre
sented every movement of nny animal for the
observation of which this apparatus was em
ployod and revolutionized the old Ideas of the
motions of quadrupeds In their several gaits
especially of those of horses I bad boon a
matter of dispute whether the horse ever had
three feet on the ground at one time when
walking These pictures settled that lie
always has two foot on the ground and part of
tho time throe tho two feet being alternately
dlaKonals and laterals
Wherever a walking horse Is I supported on
two feot und tho suspended feet are inside tho
suspended feat are invariably on the same slue
where he Is supported on two extended foot
tho suspended foot Insldo are diagonals I a
horse drops tho left hind foot on the ground
the next to follow will b tho loft foro foot fol
lowed foro by the right hind and finally by tho right
Egyptian Assyrian and Roman pictures woro
shown to demonstrate that un erroneous Idea
ot this motion prevailed In the earliest attempts
at art I was perpetuated in tho famous
statue of Marcus Aurollus which has been tho
model of almost all equestrian statues to the
present day and is an conspicuous In tho
equestrian statues of Washington In Boston
and In Union Square a In any of the old
Egyptian or Assyrian pictures I Is not pos
sible for a hon t walk In the way thero de
pleted MoUsonlor had a correct Idea of a
homes walk when ho painted his trout picture
of Napoleon In 1814 but the critics ridiculed It
and pronounced It incorrect Now he has the
satisfaction of knowing that ho was right and
they woro all wrong Miss Thompson also was
correct and the critics derided hor for being so
Now tho laugh Is ou time other sldo
A dozen pictures were next shown Illustra
tive ol a horio ambling a gait In which ho Is
never altogether clear of the ground but Is sup
ported alternately by ono and two feet the
single foot being alternately a fore and a hind
foot and the two foot alternately laterals and
diagonals This was best understood when ac
tually represented by the zoopraxlscopo and
the demonstration was so perfect as to elicit
great applau from time spectators
Time racking or pacing gait was next amply
Illustrated In it the horse moves time lateral
foot simultaneously Instead of tho diagonal
foot as in the trot Then time trot was shown in
I an exhaustive series of photographs covering
every movement of a trotting horse both at a
slow and a fast trot In the latter the horse
was at ono point In his stride entirely off tho
u t s m
Ituuuu tuu titkiii Atiu nuu iiiu luw i uittj
clear and the others not qulto touching In a
fast trot time horse Invariably puts the heel
down first never the ball of time foot or toe
By an Ingenious arrangement live cameras
five pictures wore successfully made simulta
neously from different points of view for art
late use of horses In time several attitudes of
motion and several of these foreshortened ani
mals when thrown upon the screen wore
astonishingly comic however true to nature
they unquestionably were
The cantor was next shown in which during
a portion of his stride the horse has throe feet
on the ground and the fourth almost touching
it Then the gallop was Illustrated A fast
horse going rapidly Mr Muybridgo said will
bo in the air three times in u single stride he
believed but this was only his conjecture ar
guing from the illustrations he had obtained
Tho lecturer reverted attain to ancient his
tory showing the old Kgyptlan and Assyrian
models of the running horso models blindly
followed by artists ever since In which time
animal is presented poising himself on both
hind feet extended far behind with his fore
feet stretched far out ahead of him together
The North American Indians had a much more
correct Idea of the motion of u horse as was
demonstrated by their rude pictures upon a
butlulo robe that Lafayette bought when In this
country and took back with him to Paris
Time horselas ho appears In jumping was tho
subject of tIme final series of horse pictures
and alTordod some of tho most surprising and
brilliant effects of the zoopraxlscopo In re
sponse to a question of an auditor ua to
whether time horse In jumping tot his power
from his hind Itcs time lecturer replied that ho
undoubtedly did that ho raised time front part
of bin body with his foro legs und took his
spring from his hind lent In speaking of
horses jumping ho iiid that the horse of vv hlch
some of these pictures wero mado had risen
15 feet In front of a 3 ft C in hurdle cleared It
and allgutod 11 feet beyond it In alighting
from u tump time horse always lands first on his
fore foot with them DO or 4U Inches apart
Following these pictures were a long series
ot Illustrations of tho various gaits of oxen a
wild bull Newfoundland dog hound door
goat and hog In speaking the motions of
the ox Mr Mui bridge criticised iosa Uonhetir
sharply pointing out that In her picture of
three yokes off draught oxen laboring she
mlssedltho natural movements of the beasts
Tho goat runs like a liars and time deer like
the hound bounding rather than running In
ono part of time deers stride its attitude was
very near to that hlch artists have so long in
accurately made as that of time running horse
Then there worn many moro Instantaneous
photographs of Hamol walking and running
and jumping of athletes boxing turning plain
eomoriuults and twisting xomon aultH lla
zael was very much astonished at the various
attitudes In which he had unconsciously placed
himself I whon jumping remarked the lec
turer And I should think ho would 1st l re

	<text>THE KINETOGRAPH I
Edisons Latest Invention Where
by Motion
IS RECORDED THE SAME AS SOUND
By n Phonograph Is Nothing More nor
Less than a Photograph Camera Arranged
to Do New Work In a New Way
Special to TiE HERALD Examiner Dispatch
NEW YORK May 2SThree or four years
ago in a magazine article Edison the
electric wizard wrote that he would pro
duce a machine which should record and
reproduce motion as the phonograph re
corded and reproduced sound A little
while ago there was a great convention of
womens clubs of America Mrs Edison
is interested in womens clubs and their
work and she decided to entertain the
presidents of the various clubs at the con
vention Edison entered into the plan
and when 147 club women visited his work
shop ho showed them n working model of
his new kinetoeranh for that is the name
he has given to the most wonderful of all
his wonderful inventions Surprised and
pleased the club women saw a small pine
box standing on the floor There were
some wheels and bolts near the box In
the top of the box was a hole perhaps an
inch in diameter As they looked through
this hole they saw a pipture of a man I
was a most marvelous picture It bowed
and smiled and waved its hands and tool
off its hat with the most perfect natural
ness and grace Every motion was perfect
There was not a hitch or a jerk Recently
he went to Chicago While there sqme
one interested in the Worlds fair
asked him if he was going to
get up some electrical novelty to place on
exhibition I have machine projected
replied Edison but the details
repled dotais are not per
fected yet My intention is to have such a
happy combination of electricity and
holography that a man can sit in his own
parlor and see reproduced on a screen the
forms of players in an opera produced on a
distant stage and as ho sees their move
meats hflwill hear the sound of their voices
as they talk or sing or laugh When theth
machine is perfected which it will be long
before it can be exhibited at tho fair each
little muscle of the gingers face will be
eon by the world His facial expression
with every change will be exactly repro
puced and the stride and positions will be
natural and will vary as ao those of tho
person himself
When this interview was published hero I
a couple of weeks ago people laughed again
and said Edison had been having fun with
some Chicago reporter Edison sat in
court all day Tuesday during the argument
of his counsel for an injunction to restrain
the United States Electric Light company
from making incandescent lamps A re
porter asked him about this phenomenal
machine and was invited to go out to I
his laboratory at Orange and see a model L
of the machine This morning thE repor
erfound Mr Edison at his laboratory and L
showed him a copy of the Chicago interview I
Edison Lead it and lau ha Yes tis
true he said You can sit i your par I
lor and look ata big screen and seeTChaun i
coy Depew come out just asif he was intro i
ducing Stanley at the Metropolitan opera
house He will walk up to the front of f
the stage bow and smile and take a drink
of water and start off with his oration
oraton
Every time your eyes see him open his
mouth your ears will hear what he says
that is i he says anything
How do you expect to do all that Mr
Edison 1
I it is desired to reproduce an opera or
play I will get a company to give a dress
rehearsal for me I place back of the orchestra
chestra on a table a compound machine
consIsting of a phonograph and a kineto
graph with a capacity of thirty minutes
continuous work The orchestra plays
the curtain rises and the opera begins
Both machines work simultaneously on
recording the sound and the other taking
holographs recording motion at the
rte of fortysix photographs per sec
ond Afterward the photographic
strip is developed and placed in
the machine A projecting lens is substi
tuted for a photographic leus and the re
producing part of the phonograph is adjusted
justed Then by means of a calcium light
the effect is reproduced life size on a white I
curtain reproducing to the audience the
original scene with all its sounds and all
he motions of the actors exactly as in the
original scene
phonograph which MrEdison will use
in his compound motion and sound repro
ducer will be an improvement on the
phonographs now in common use He said
today he had now in use about five hun
dred phonographs of which ho has taken
constant observations The result of all
these observations ho will embody in an
improved phonoaraph to be used with the
kinetograph
The kinetograph is nothing more nor less
i than a photograph camera arranged in a
new way to do new work In this small
box camera Mr Edison places a roll of
golatine film about threequarters of an
inch wide and of any length desired The
interior of the camera of course is arranged
on a plan similiar to that on which the or
dinary roll cameras are made The gelatine
strip is unrolled from one spindle and re
rolled on another and in passing from the
first spindle to the second is carried before
the lens of the camera The shutters of the
camera are arranged to be worked by the
shaft attached to the oyclinder of the
phonograph This shaft also works the
spindles which carry the rolls of film The
machanicsm of this camera is so arranged
that when shutters open the spindles stop
and the gelatine film is fixed before the
lens In less than the fortysixth part of a
second the photograph is taken the shut
ters snap tho spindles turn and the gelatine
slip moves on for a new photograph The
arrangement is so complete that fortysix
perfect photographs are taken in one
second
The trouble with all attempts heretofore
made t reproduce action and motion by
photograph said Edison was the photo
graphs could not be taken in a series with
sufficient rapidity to catch accurately the
motion it was desired to reproduco My
idea was to take a series of instantaneous
photographs of motions so rapidly that in
the reproduction the photographic repre
sentatives become resolved into I pure
motion instead of I series of jerks The
kinetograph takes a series of fortysix
photographs in one second and keeps it up
as long as desired It starts moves stops
uncloses the shutter takes a photograph
closes the shutter and starts on fortysi
times a second The result when repro
duced Is a pure motion
To illustrate what he said Mr Edison
took ono of the rolls of gelatine film which
had been through the kinetograph and
showed it the reporter On it was photo
graphed one of tho boys in his laboratory
The photographs were about half an inch
square and were taken in the film at inter
vals of about an inch They represented
the boy in the act of taking off his hat and
bowing Between the first view and the
last of the series the complete motion of
removing the hat and making the bow was
cleanly diacernoble but between any two
consecutive views there was no apparent
change in the position of the boys arm or
band In the front view the boys band
was at his side Gradually it was raised to
ward his head and his head inclined forward
Then the hat was removed and the bow
completed after which the hat was re
placed
To reproduce perfectly a complete
record of a pure motion continued Mr
r
Edison it is necessary tho photographs
should be taken at tho rate of fortysix per
second any smaller number would show
irregularities and a break in the motion
There was a machine mado a while
ago to print pictures of an object in motion
but it would not work fast enough It re
produced imperfect and jerky motion
like this And he illustrated by raising
his arm in a series of short jerks to his
shoulder
How did find out that fortysix photo
graphs must be taken every second Well
Ive been experimenting with this thing for
a long time now Ivo got it that is Ive
got the germ or base principle When you
got your base principle right then it is only
a question of time and a matter of details
about completing the machine The details
can all bo worked out after you get the
germs Come up stairs and see tho germ
work
I is a question which part of tho kineto
graph Edison himself regards as the great
est part of his invention the arrangement
for taking tho photographs or the contriv
ance for reproducing them I was the re
producing contrivance which he showed to
the reporter as the germ r
To outward appearance tho germ is
nothing but a pine box which looks very
much as i it might have been originally in
tended as a packing case for shoes or
boots I stood on end in front of a lathe
and the open top was nearest to tho
the lathe In the upper end was cut a hole
about an inch in diameter and in this hole
was set a lens On the bottom of the box
was arranged a series of wheels and
seres
spindles A roll of gelatine film was placed
on a spindle on one side of the bottom The
end of tho gelatine strip was then carried
over one of the wheels and past the lens in
the hole in tho top of the box and another
spindle on the other side of tho
box bottom and fastened to a small
belt that ran from the lathe to the shaft
tle
on which was set the spindle to which the
end of the gelatino film was fastened
When the motor was turned on the roll of
gelatine strip was transferred from the
first spindle to the second and in the trans
fer passed under the lens The photo
graphs on the slip came out as the germ
A s it was worked fast or slow the repro
duction showed apure motion or a series of
jerks When it was run at the highest
speed tho reporter saw a young fellow
waving his hand and touching his hat Af
ter running tho germ for a while at full
speed Edison had it slowed down a little
A t once a difference bncamo apparent and
th reasons of the failure of the machino
to which Edison had referred him
were quite evident Instead of reproduc
ing a smooth pure motion the strip showed
under the lens a lazy indifferent young
fellow who moved himself by jerks and
whoso actions were abrupt and unsteady
In a few weeks Mr Edison will be ready
to make a test of the practical powers of
the germ on a much larger scule In the
office of the laboratory he has had an im
mense screen put up sucn as is used for
storeoptican exhibitions The screen
hangs over a big fireplace and colors the
side of the wall As soon as he can perfect
some little details of the kintograph ho will L
make a trial at life size of the reproduction I
of this big succes Mr Edison says the
kintograph can be made to run for any de
sired length of time
I can put a roll of gala tne strip a mil I
long into it if I like said its inventor to
day The work it will do in half an houi
is something astonishing Taking forty
six photographs per second in half an hour
there will be 82800 photographs on a gela
tine strip
I tne photographs were half an inch
squrae and half an inch apart the strip of
film used in taking the thirtyminute of
an opera would be 0000 feet long and Mr
Edison would need something more than
his mile of gelatine Therd is not one of
us who has not seen theidea in use hun
dreds of times Children in the streets
have for playthings little windmills whose
painted arms embody the very idea Edison
ha used in the kintograph One arm will
have a part of a figure painted the next
arm andther part the ext another and so
on and as the arms whirl rapidly around
one looking on sees only a perfect picture
That is the whole scheme</text>

and cold Edison Is well named the wiz
ard he is the great magician of science
and we have grown somewhat accustomed

the time has come to get excited Noth
ing that I had read about the kinetoscope

	<text>NOVELTIES IN THE REALMS
OF
SCIENCE, LITERATURE
AND
ART
ITOOK in one of the kinetoecope
rooms on Broadway this afternoon,
having for a companion a gen
tleman who has just returned
from Europe, says the New York
correspondent of the Pittsburg Dispatch.
After ho had taken a few peeps at the
latest things with which the interesting
toys have been loaded he said: "These
are all very well in their way, but they're
not in it with tho cinematographe." The
■word made a big mouthful, and he
paused awhile before resuming in this
■wise: "Just before I left London I was
one of a select company present at a pri
vate view of the cinematographe. What
is it? Why, as Celia says in 'As You Like
It,' 'Oh, wonderful, wonderful, and most
wonderful, wonderful.' It is the latest de
velopment of instantaneous photography,
by which an accurate development is pro
tiuced in pictures of real, living, moving
ecenes. To obtain an idea of the im
pression produced, you have only to im
agine a photograph come to life, with
every movement faithfully reproduced. It
is photography taken Mn the action' and
api lied, not to single living figures only,
but to whole scenes. A puff of smoke
from a steam engine, the spray of the sea,
the gestures and movements of every indi
vidual member of a crowd— all this is
shown on the screen upon which the
pictures are projected. The figures are al
most life-size, and the remarkable effects
produced are almost indescribable and
positively uncanny in their realism.
"Wonderful as was each one of the
series which I had the pleasure of viewing,
I will only bore you with a couple, which
I consider the most wonderful of all the
'Arrival of tbe Train' and 'bathing.' In
the first, you see the rush of the locomo
tive, the gradual slackening, the stoppage
at the station the crowd on the platform
steps back, the carriage doors open, tbe
passengers alight and others take their
places. All is bustle and confusion. In
'bathing' a number of lads dive from a
pier into the sea. As they me^t the water
the spray rises from the waves that are
rolling with a verisimilitude that is start
ling. But the interest of the tiling is in
exhaustible, for once the flush of novelty
is passed, the attraction may be revived
and revived again by new pictures. Where
all this is going to end one cannot tell.
For the present, however, in this French
development of Edison's toy, London has
the biggest attraction of the sort that it
has had for years. Of course the cinemato
jiraphe will astonish New York ere long.
When you see it you'll not set me down
a romancer, either." We'll wait and see.</text>

	<text>EDISON'S LATEST
A new inventlop by Thomas A Edison
was shown to a few favored persons at the
West Orange laboratory one evening last
week. The new machine is really a grown
up kinetoscope and it is a success in the
opinion of the New York Herald.
Mr Edison calls bin latest invention the
vitascope which be says means a machine
showing lifo and that is exactly what the
new apparatus does
The vitascope which has been in process
of perfection at the Llewellyn laboratory for
tire last seven or eight months under Mr.
Edisn's direction Is the ideal ha had in
mind he says when he began work on the
kinetoscopo machine with which he has
never been satisfied.
The vitascope is an improvement of the
kinetoscope by which moving life size figures
ures of men women and animals are thrown
upon a screen by means of bright lights and
powerful lenses. The trial of the new machine
chine was made in a cold corner o1 the big
foundry at the works and Mr. Edison with
Richard N. Dyer William J Gilmour manager
ager of the phonograph works Rap Cam-
men of New York and a few invited guests
huddled around a red hot stove and gazed
at and admired the marvelous figures thrown
upon a big white screen at coo end of the
room
The first picture shown was a colored pano-
ranma of a serpentine dance by Anabelle svho
went out to West Orange to pose one day
last summer The film roll on which the
photographs were attached was arranged over
a half dozen spools apd pulleys and the machine
chino was sot in motion
Even the inventor himself was surprised
at the result although with ills usual critical
ical eye ho discovered flaws in the com which
lie declared must be disposed o1 before the
vitascope would come up to his ideal
Anabelle danced for five minutes and then
a panorama of the latest English Derby was
thrown upon the screen
The feature of the new maehino which as-
toniehed all who saw the views was the almost
most entire absence of vibration In the plc-
tures as they appeared on the screen and
which had been the hardest obstacles to surmount
mount 1n perfecting the apparatus
The original photographs as by time kineto-
scope and developed on the film roll are
about the size of a special delivery postage
stamp and to produce a life size picture they
are magnified about abc hundred times. Of
course each vibration of the com or the apparatus
paratus which rovaives It Is magnified l like
proportion and every previous do
away with this vibration lad been unsuccessful
ful
Mr. Edison expects to be able soon to improve
prove time pilonograph so ho will bo able to
take records double the length of these
which the present'cyllnders will contain and
the vitascope and phonograph will then hose
so combined that It will be possible for an
audl011ce to watch a photograpldo repfodue-
tion of a grand opera and hear the singers
and see the acting with as much distinctness
of sound and vision as if they were in the
opera house</text>

were ever taken in this or any other
country.
There is not photographic film
enough west of the Mississippi river, In
all the moving picture concerns to
gether to take the pictures of the Brltt-
Nelson contest If It happens to go the
prescribed limit of forty-flve rounds.
While the contest may not go to the
limit, it will be necessary to have
enough film on hand to cover every
round and close figuring on the part of
the picture man has resulted in his
ordering about twelve miles of film
from New York. Harry Miles, the resi
dent partner of the firm, has wired his
brother Herbert, and the latter will
leave New York city tonight, bringing
this most important part of the out
fit with him to insure its safe and
prompt arrival.
Harry Miles and his assistants are
j the greatest experts at the moving pic
ture game in this part of the country,
but a special force of three more men
from the east who have worked for
Miles Brothers and other large con
cerns In the moving picture line will
be brought on to help take and develop
the moving pictures.
Pictures Twelve Miles Long
Imagine a chain of pictures twelve
miles long and that is what a full-forty
flve rounds of fighting will make. The
chain of pictures if joined together
would. reach from the office of the Col
ma club in the Columbian on Market
street down to Colma, around the pa
vilion and back again. As the crow flies
it would reach from the club's office to
the Cliff house and back again, or
could be stretched from the city hall
In San Francisco to the city hall in
Oakland.
Forty-flve rounds of fighting will
take up three hours of time and to
show .the moving pictures as they
should be shown on the screen will take
exactly the same length of time. There
are to be three machines set in place,
but only one of these will be working at
one time, the other two simply being
there in case of anything happening.
Three special lenses have been ordered
for the bioscope cameras and these are
as expensive as diamonds of the same
size would be.
The longest film that was ever used
in this country for moving pictures was
probably that of the fight between Jef
fries and Sharkey, which lasted twenty
five rounds. These pictures will be
taken at the rate of 1200 exposures to
the minute, and after they are taken it
will take about five days with the pic
ture men -working night and day to
develop and fix them up ready for use.
J. W. Coffroth, manager of the Col
ma club. Is already receiving many bids
from all parts, of the country from
shop people and others who wish to
buy the rights to show them. IT-.aV
The greatest feature of all about these
pictures will be the fact that when
they, are taken it will be possible to
show clearjy and distinctly every blow
that Is struck and where it lands.
There will possibly be 100 separate ex
posures or pictures of every blow that
is struck. It will be possible to ex
pose these pictures on the screen so
slowly that any one will be able to see
-where a punch lands and how It was
delivered in any part of the fight. If
ever there is. a foul blow, struck in the
course of the fight about which there
is any question -after it is all over,- the
little moving picture machine which
will play such an Important part in the
big contest will be the judge from
whose decision there can be no appeal.</text>

GEORGE INGERSOLL.
Funny things have happened in mo
tion pictures, both in the films and in
the theatrical world. No use telling
you all about the fiinn.v things in the
films. You have seen them often
enough.
Take the theatres themselves. Tt.
was nickle madness to go to them at
all 10 years ago. Many of them were
holes in the wall, worse than cheap
saloons.
Now they call the theatres picture
palaces. They have taken the place
of saloons as a place to go and be
refreshed. They are sometimes re
garded as a menace to the regular
theatre and the spoken drama. But
are they?
Regular theatrical producers were
once inclined to disregard tho movies.
They were a fad, and people would
soon tire of them.
But the movies chased the popular
priced melodramas out of the cheap
theatres. Where did they go- Why
the stories went into the films and so
did the stock actors and stock di
rectors. They knew melodrama bv
heart. They made up the stories for
movies as they went along Nobody
paid money for stories in those days.
No established writers and no thea

A millionaire flapper without the

She had to be procured, so Lloyd

for one.
They went over a list of twenty
leading screen flappers. Then fifty
different types were given screen tests.
Finally they selected Clara Bow, a 17-
year-old Brooklyn girl, who has only
appeared in two screen plays.
But that wasn't the end of their
trouble in connection with the flap

Several visits to leading hotels

that he can leave the hospital today

attendants.
Savage Is said to have attempted
suicide when Clara Bow, piquant
film actress, refused his offer of
marriage. The former Yale foot
ball star, it was said, tried to
sweep Miss Bow off her feet In a
cyclonic courtship, and deluged her
with his poetry.
Savage was somewhat dejected
today, over Miss Bow’s statement
that his suicide attempt was merely
a dramatic gesture. “I’ll make her
love me yet,” he said.
“When a man really wants' to
kill himself," the little actress de
clared, “he shoots himself with a
pistol and doesn’t just cut his wrist
with a safety razor blade.”
Miss Bow said she had done every
thing sh© could to discourage Sav
age, but he persisted, saying he
“would make me love him.”
“I am so sorry at the whole af
fair,” the actress declared. “I will
visit him toejay, and I hope it will

Clara Bow is throwing a “Wild
Party” this week at the Earle

Clara breaks into the talkie*
and that's the interesting feature
of her latest offering, for the play
Itself is one of her typical flappei
productions. Miss Bow’J voice is
very good, possessing a rich qual
ity and natural tone.
The story has to do with life at
dear old Winston—not the kind of
chop] life we remember. Several
so-called parties provide complica
tions. not serious, but sufficient to
make a story. These lead to a
soliloquy by the star on life, the
wild party, hence the name. Clara
Bow makes whopee with the able
assistance of Marceline Day and
Shirley O’Hara and a bevy of other
lovely girls. The man in the case
is an unsuspecting and very
human single professor, intelligent
ly portrayed by Frederic March.
Miss Bow is noted for her ex
ceptional ability in extricating her
self from what should be embar
rassing situation and the “Wild
i Party” affords more than one such
occasion. A well-timed fire drill
for instance sets the sage for a
regular pajama party, and inci
dentally styles in lounging apparel
are varied and interesting.
Short features includes a splen
did offering, “Words of Love,” by
Julia Sanderson and Frnak Crum'.t

HOLLYWOOD, January 15 (N.A.N.A.).
—We’re enjoying? che Clara Bow-Daisy

wood.
All the traffic cops are over in Los
Angeles trying to clear away for
Judge Doran to get to his chambers,
for all the surrounding countryside,
fired by headlines and pictures, have
flocked to the seat of justice to get, if
possible* the direct vibration of the
most torrid lady of the screen.
The two girls, who met on a studio
lot when one was a star and the other
a hairdresser, who got chummy and
wrapped their arms about each other
and talked about “boys” and “love” and
"life,” are providing the rarest little bit
of human drama for the multitude that
has been served them in many a day.
Clara Bow confided in Daisy De Voe
Until Daisy became a menace. She
knew so much, they had exchanged so
many gifts, things had been so very
thick between them that, according to
form, they were due for a fight.
Tuesday Clara Bow, testifying on the
ease, looked down at her blond Daisy,
her chum and confidante of other days,
and said in a hoarse, emotional whisper:
“You needn’t sneer at me that way,
Daisy!”
Daisy smiled imperturbably, although
Clara Bow’s eyes filled with unshed
tears. If advisers, attorneys, managers
and more practical-minded people
didn’t surround Clara Bow, she’d have
her arms about Daisy in no time, and
the two would be down at the corner
drug store having an ice cream soda
and laughing and crying over the whole
thing.
That’s the kind of a girl Clara Bow
Is from birth, and being a star or hav
ing several hundred thousand dollars to
spend instead of two and a half a
week isn’t going to change her.
But those who got inside the court
house Tuesday had the very great
pleasure of hearing the red-head de
fend herself quite smartly and cleverly
against the questioning of the ex-secre
tary's attorney.
With quivering chin. Clara Bow ad
mitted that Daisy De Voe wanted $125,-

and telegrams which had been sent to

	<text>IN MUSICAL PLAT
Clara Bow Stars in “Love
Among the Millionaires”
at Coliseum Theatre
"Rarin' to Go!" Clara Bow and
a throng of Paramount's come
dians, including Mitzi Green,
Skeets Gallagher and Stuart Er
win, are coming to the Coliseum
theatre tonight in “Love Among
the Millionaires.”
Chain-Lightning Romance
Full of real redheaded pepper
and chain lightning romance, "Love
Among the Millionaires,, is a fine
musical comedy for Clara Bow.
•Rarin' to Go" is only one of
her songs, but this song, a real
jazzy dance number, probably gives
the greatest play to the Bow per
sonality. Then “Believe It or
Not, I've Found My Man” is a
joyous lyric. Clara follows this with
a rendition of “That’s Worth
While Waiting For." The theme
song of the picture, “That's Love
Among the Millionaires,” is her
fourth number.
"Love Among the Millionaires"
has a true Bow throb story. Clara,
unwittingly, falls in love yith a
brakeman on the railroad, Stan
ley Smith, who turns out to be the
son of the president of the road.
Neither Stanley’s father nor Clara's
approves of the match and a deal
of family complication ensues be
fore the matter is finally straight
ened out to the satisfaction of
everyone.
Little Mitzi Green mimicks Clara
Bow in this picture, and sings a

A LITTLE Chinese girl hu become the
toast of Hollywood—but she had to
go to Europe to attain this position.
Anna May Wong is this girl, the
Anna May Wong who spent her early
years living above her father's
laundry, whose only farewells r. Lien she left for
Germany were from her family and who re
turned to Hollywood a few weeks ago to be
greeted by a throng of film folk, reporters and
photographers.
To understand Anna May. you must go back
many years to the marriage of her mother and
father.
Her father lived in Sunning. Canton, China.
And her mother came from Northern China
near Peiping. Immediately after their marriage
they migrated to Los Angeles, where Wong ex

chance her English text books for Chlnesa
volumes and tush off to a thiee-hour session tn
Chinese private school.
Many times Anna May and her sisters ob
jected to the strenuous study and work forced
upon them. Why should they learn to read,
write and speak Chinese? What good would It
do them? Their father merely replied that It
was his wish that his children should know the
language of their ancestors.
“I am very glad now that father insisted
upon us studying ChineseJi- the charming ac
tress says. “Had I not done so I would have
missed much that is beautiful in life. I now
knew the wisdom and philosophy of my people
through the knowledge of their language.
Father knew what was ahead of us. How
wise he was!"
Vacations never were favored by the head
of the Wong family As a result the children
always attended Summer school. Consequently
when Anna May entered high school she was
the youngest student in that institution—and,
you might say, the smartest
Piano study was added to her list of high
school subjects at this time, leaving her little
time to dwell upon her secret longing to be
come an actress.
This longing was of several years duration,
dating back to a Chinese New Year celebra
tion when she was six years old and her father
took his family to their first picture show.
“To this day I can remember in detail the
six pictures that were shown that night for
live cents per person,” declares Miss Wong.
Pearl White was in a serial. Eddie Polo was
in another picture There was a Keystone eop
comedy and a melodrama that gave me night
mares for a week afterward."
During her third year in high school. Anna
May suffered a nervous breakdown. The fam
ily's Chinese physician prescribed rest under
the sun. true to the traditions of his people,
who believe that the sun will cure many ail
ments Pot weeks afterward Anna May haunt
ed the beaches and parks in search of health.
But she tired of spending long hours doing
nothing but sitting So she ssked her oouain,
James Wong, a film actor, to take her with
to the studio This James consented to
do, always her with him whenever he
had a locatVy" call so that she could remain
in the freeh air That was before the stuthos
became ae particular about having visitors
around.

Anna May Wong, as she will appear
in "Daughter of the Dragon
would wander over to where she was sitting
and engage her In a conversation for a few
moments at a time.
The man was Marshall Neilan, at that time
one of Hollywood's beat directors. It was huge
ly through him that Anna May s life took a
sudden turn and she found herself a scree*
actress, far better known within a very short
time than her cousin James.
There was some consternation in the Wong
household when Anna May came home one
night and told of an offer she had received
from Neilan to play a role in a picture, "DUsty.'’
which he was about to start.
Wong and his wife sat up that night long
after the children had retired, discussing the
proposition from all angles. They knew that
she would abide by their decision if they ob
jected to her taking the role. But would it be
quite fair to rob their daughter of such an
opportunity? The following morning Wfcng
V called his daughter and said:
"I haven’t much faith in these things called
moving pictures. Yet the most honored pro
fessional men in all China are acton. If feu
will take your sister with you as a chaperon
and get home every night in time for eur
evening meal you may accept the offer.”
Little did he realize when he made that
statement that within a few years his daugh
ter's name would be dancing In electric lights
the world over.
When Anna May first stepped In front of
the cameras her fears were unbounded. But
she soon was made to feel at ease by the Bnd’
ness of Neilan and her fellow players, Wesl-jf
Barry. Marjorie Daw, Pat O'Malley and Noah
Beery.
"Dinty” placed the young Chinese girl well
on the road to success. No sooner had it been
released than she was deluged with offers from
casting directors in every studio. For more
than a year she was kept constantly busy and
her salary continued to grow.
She easily was earning enough to take her
family from their laundry house quarters, but
th y preferred to stay there, and Anna Mag
stayed with them.
Then she signed a contract with a motion
picture company operating in San Francisco.
The company was unable to raise the necessary
money for their production, but they refused
to release Miss Wong until the termination of
her contract one year later. Thus she was
kept off the screen entirely for one year.

	<text>ANNA MAY WONG’S CLEVER POSE
This shows the face and hands of Anna May Wong, young
Chinese actress, born in the United States. There could be
no better arrangement of a photograph to show, in condensed
•pace, the spirit dwelling within.
From the face and the hands you learn more than from all
the rest of the body, all, in fact, that you need to know.
The eyes reflect the mind and spirit, the mouth reveals
emotions, cold, passionate or neutral.
The forehead, in this case too much concealed, is most
important of all, for that which is back of the forehead is
really THE HUMAN BEING.
As for the hands, they tell a thousand stories. The fingers,
long, tapering, with the hand itself narrow, show what we
call "refinement,” the absence of hard work through a num
ber of generations.
Fingers blunt at the end, with broad nails, tell one story.
Too much "refinement” in the hands may show that a
person belongs to a family dying out, losing energy. Refine
ment is admirable, but there must always be STRENGTH, to
make refinement efficient and useful.
In the thumb alone you may read character.
According to the Kiralfy brothers, theatrical men of long
ago, you can tell from the thumb the shape of the whole body.
The Kiralfys, producing the "Black Crook,” and other per
formances in which young ladies were displayed in tights, in
the old days, needed young ladies with well-shaped legs.
But the Kiralfys said: "All we need to see is the girl’s thumb.
As soon as we see the thumb we know just how she will look
in tights.” This, presumably, saved the young ladies apply
ing for jobs some embarrassment, and saved time for the
Kiralfys.
Study hands and faces, eyes for sincerity, the chin for
force of character, the ears for generosity, or the reverse, the
mouth for emotion, the forehead for intelligence, the hands
for the physical and racial past, and you study a human
being completely.
In addition, you will be interested in this young face, com
bining the mystery of the East with the Western influence of
birth in this country.</text>

the American Chineae girl who sup
plied the Oriental allure to the mo
tion picture industry for 15 years,
had her first glimpse of China here
the other day when she stepped ofi
the gangplank of a liner from San
Francisco
She plans to pa* a year in the
Orient. After seeing Hongkong and
Canton and after visiting her mother
and sisters whom she hasn't seen
for years. Miss Wong will travel
throughout the country to see the
‘real" China, not the China she
knew In the movies, from books and
from hearsay.
Hopes to Learn Language
Incidentally she hopes to leam
the Chines* language, but she un
derstands It Is difficult.
Rumors of a romance accompanied
her arrival here. Fellow passengers
on the steamer whispered Into ship
news reporters’ ears when the liner
docked that the son of a millionaire
Canton merchant was waiting for
her to be his bride. No such thing.
Miss Wong denied promptly. She Is
"wedded to her art."
No Movte Actress Airs
There Is none of the movie actress
airs abcut demure, placid Anna
Wong. She scorns make-up—a lit
tle lipstick Is her only concession—
snd she has some ideas of her own
concerning the things she wears.
"Years of experimenting with
western clothing have convinced me
that the only colors that really suit
Orientals are black and white." she
said. "It Is ridiculous for us to ac
cept bllndl; the current fashions of
New York and Paris."
As if In demonstration, she was
wearing an almost severe black suit
with white waist, an outfit the sim
plicity of which was well suited to
her aopearance and manner.
Her Opinion of Hollywood
Hollywood?
"What the mo* »e capital needs is
freshness, freshness in everything
characters, plots, actors and ac
tresses.” she asserted. "No wonder
such stars as Garbo and Dietrich
had such meteoric success
"The adaptation of commonplace
stories no longer satisfies cinema
audiences, and producers are in
creasingly looking abroad for un
usual material, which opens further
opportunities for foreign playera.
"When the talkies came everyone
thought the foreign actors then In
Hollywood would be thrown out of
Jobs because they couldn’t speak
English without an accent. It didn't
work out that way arid now foreign
players are In demand for films with
foreign backgrounds Just because of
that accent.
Real Accent Needed
Tor example. In a film with a plot
laid In China, no American actor
trying to impersonate an Oriental
can fake an accent properly. Under
such circumstances there is In
creasing opportunity for Orientals to
win a place for themselves in the
films in competition with western

revealed by police here today.
Both Miss Wong and Mrs. Selz

CONFESSES
HOLLYWOOD, March 26 (I.N.
S.). —Arresting one woman and
.announcing they had cleaned up
,a new phase of the case, author
ities today were still confronted
.'with the bizarre extortion plot
.directed against Anna May Wong,
;Chinese screen star, and Mrs.
David O. Selznick, wife of the film
■producer.
1 A middle-aged woman from Du
luth. Minn., was arrested and
charged with writing a new threat
note to Evangelist Aimee Semple
McPherson.
At the same time police re
vealed that the evangelist received
another note yesterday signed “A.
M. Foote.” the same signature
that appeared on the notes re
ceived by Miss Wong and Mrs.
Selznick.
The suspect, who gave her name
as Mrs. Lydia Swenson, 51, was
arrested in her home. After
lengthy questioning she confessed,
stating:
"I needed S2OO for the down
payment on a new car.”
One of the notes received by
the evangelist demanded that'
amount and conveyed a warning
of “The Black Hand.”
Officers admited, however, that i
Mrs. Swenson could not have had
any connection with the other
note received by Mrs. McPher
son, nor with those received by
the film figures.
The second note received yester
day by Mrs. McPherson demanded
that she meet the writer to dis
cuss a biblical picture which he

	<text>Anna May Wong Is Ready
To Resume Picture Career
Actress, Playing Here, Tires of Pvetirement
and Would Return to Screen, But
Not as Villainess.
BY HARRY Mac ARTHUR.
HERE'S one motion picture star who was brought up on the way*
of old and won't cast aside the traditions of the Hollywood of the past
When she stepped from a train yesterday afternoon at Union
Station, Anna May Wong, the young ladv who’s played more
Oriental villalnesses than Myma Loy and five other actresses, was told she
had reservations at two different hotels. Which one did she want to
keep?
“Oh. keep ’em both, she replied,
blandly indifferent to the fact that
getting even one hotel reservation in
this town is often an achievement of
no little note. "There’s no use being
crowded.”
Renewing her acquaintance with
Linton Wells, meeting Broderick
Crawford, chatting pleasantly with
them, Miss Wong says she's about
over the effects of those recent
extortion threats.
It took something of a breakdown
at Palm Springs to let all of the
nerves out of her system, she admits,
but now all is well. When she first
received the threats on her life, she
tightened up inside and didn't let
off steam. Could have loosened
things up by tossing a bit of furni
ture around, she knows, but she was
at a friend's house and felt it would
not be joropeT to toss a friend's furni
ture about.

T^OW she’s going back to work.
For the last couple of years
Miss Wong lias been loafing, trying
to kid herself into thinking she’s
retiring, she calls it. But it hasn’t
agreed with her and she's putting an
end to loafing right now with a pair
of stage appearances—one here at
the Capitol and the other in New
York.
New York, she likes, because it puts
her in contact with people who are
doing things. Seems to have given
her a desire to get back in the lists,
so *he probably will be homing back
to the Paramount studios before many
moons.
The only reason she decided to
retire from films In the first place,
•ays Miss Wong, was this business</text>

	<text>Her first taste of hospitality in the land
of her ancestors was a banquet of
forty-three courses in Shanghai. For
Anna May Wong, the beautiful
'Chinese-American star of the screen, found
that fame had preceded her and that an ova
tion was waiting for her, when she made her
first trip to the Orient some fifteen months
ago. Everybody was eager to entertain her,
including the delightful Chinese Ambassador
to France and his wife. Dr. and Mrs. Welling
ton Koo, who had tiffin in her honor. Or in
plain American, they gave a luncheon for her.
Anna May Wong, whose Chinese name,
Wong Lu Taong, means Frosted Yellow Wil
lows, spent her childhood on Flower Street in
the Chinatown of Los Angeles. When she was
twelve she stole away from school and got
herself accepted as one of a large crowd in a
movie scene. It was a disappointment for,
when the picture was released, the child could
not distinguish herself in the throng, let alone
be distinguished by others to whom she had
been boasting.
Since then, however, the tall Chinese girl
has made an international reputation for
herself as a motion picture star. Unforgettable
in the American pictures, “Limehouse Blues,”
“Daughter of the Dragon,” “Mr. Wu,”
“Shanghai Express,” Anna May Wong has
also made splendid pictures in Germany and
England. ‘Tsong” was a German film, while
her favorite motion picture parts came to her
in the English productions, "The Pavement
Butterfly” and “Piccadilly.”
Anna May Wong loves China. "And to
me,” she says, "Peiping is China.” Here you
find the gardens that have been lovely for
centuries, and all the splendor and beauty of
ancient China, which so entrance her.
But she finds pleasure also in the China
towns of our American cities. “As soon as I
arrive in a city," she will tell you, “I am eager
to find Chinatown. Ten years ago when I was
in New York for the first time, I said: ‘I want
to see Chinatown.’ And when we came there,
I caught at once the fragrance of musk which
I love to smell.
“As for Chinese food I like it so much that
I am almost intoxicated with the pleasure
of it. I always try to reciprocate hospitality
by giving a Chinese dinner once a fortnight.
When I am stopping at a hotel I take my
friends to a top restaurant in Chinatown.
“The Chinese, you know, can take almost
Anything and fix it up into a marvelous meal.
Chop suey, which Americans usually think of
as a particular dish, is really unknown in
China, at least in the sense in which foreigners
speak of it. </text>
